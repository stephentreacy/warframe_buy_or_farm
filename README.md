# Warframe Buy or Farm
A work in progress to find the price of prime items in Warframe. Used to get a quick overview of prices and decide if the item should be bought.

Takes selected items from personal https://tenno.zone/planner/ link.

Uses the https://warframe.market/ API to get current orders for each item.

Prints 4 of the highest buy orders and lowest sell orders.

Running the python script produces the image below. Items to considering buying from other players highlighted.
